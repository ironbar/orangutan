<h1>Animal-AI Olympics rules</h1>

<code style="display:block;white-space:pre-wrap">
PLEASE READ THESE rules CAREFULLY. Entry into the Animal-AI Olympics constitutes acceptance of these rules. If you do not agree to any part of these rules, do not enter the competition.

Terms used

Competition: The Animal-AI Olympics as described here and on the competition website.
Competition website: Refers to the main website for the competition http://animalaiolympics.com/ and either of the three sites linked from the main website, https://github.com/beyretb/AnimalAI-Olympics, https://mdcrosby.com/blog and https://evalai.cloudcv.org/ (Animal-AI-specific link forthcoming).
Competition organisers: The organisers of the Animal-AI Olympics competition as listed on the competition website, including, where applicable, affiliated institutions.
Prize Provider: Any provider of any prize, or portion thereof, for the competition.

Dates.

The competition commences at 11:59pm GMT on July 1st.
Uploading on the competition website will be available by 11:59pm GMT on July 8th.
The first test phase will be at 11:59pm AOE on September 1st. Submissions past this date will not be counted. If there is enough funding to run extended testing the test phase will contain additional small variations of the tests and participants score may therefore differ from that received during the main competition phase. Results from this phase will be used for the distribution of AWS credits prizes. Prizes will be distributed in a commercially reasonable time-frame.
Depending on progress, additional, more complex tests, may be added to the test set once results have been collated.
The second and final test phase will be at 11:59pm AOE on November 1st. Submissions past this date will not be counted. If there is enough funding to run extended testing the test phase will contain additional small variations of the tests and participants score may therefore differ from that received during the main competition phase. Results will be announced by November 15th. Prizes will be distributed in a commercially reasonable time-frame.
Note that Competition deadlines are subject to change should they need to for any reason. Any additional or altered deadlines will be publicized via the Competition Website.

Honour Code

In addition to the behaviours outlined by the official competition rules, "cheating" encompasses any attempt to gain an edge by attempting to access information in a way that is not intended. Examples of cheating include (but are not limited to):

    Attempting to abuse the competition infrastructure to gain an edge;
    Attempting to obtain information about the configuration files used for the tests beyond the information available on competition website;
    Attempting to use any information from the environment during testing beyond the input given to the agent.

Please note that we reserve the right, but do not have the obligation, to review submitted code to disqualify any contributions demonstrating cheating, and we reserve the right to determine what competition organisers believe, in their sole discretion, constitutes cheating. We respectfully request that you refrain from cheating.

Awarding the prize is at the sole discretion of the judges and their decision will be final with no recourse to appeal. 

All prizes are non-transferable, and no substitutions of the prizes for cash, alternate goods or services, or any other prize is permitted. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, competition organisers reserve the right to provide a substitute prize of approximately equal value for any reason.

Any prize details not specified in these rules will be determined solely by the competition organisers.
&nbsp;
The prizes will be awarded within a commercially reasonable time frame. All members of a Team may be required to complete and sign additional documentation, such as a non-disclosures, representations and warranties, liability and publicity releases (unless prohibited by applicable law), and tax documents, or other similar documentation in order for the potentially winning team to claim the prize. For Teams in excess of one member, the prize will be awarded to the Team Lead. Competition organisers will in no way be involved in any dispute with respect to receipt of a prize by any other members of a Team.
Prize providers shall not be liable, and no claim shall be made, for any injury or damage to persons or property that may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entry/participation in the Event or the receipt or use of any prize or failure to receive any prize.

Potential winners will be contacted via the email associated with the Team through which the entry was submitted.

Only one alternate winner will be selected per each prize package, after which prizes will remain unawarded. To the extent that there is any dispute as to the identity of the potential winner, the official account holder of the email address associated with the EvalAI account through which the entry was first submitted will be deemed the official potential winner.
